    <dd>One of the famous Serial Killers. The killer fashioned this name for himself in <u>taunting letters he sent to the Bay Area Press</u>. He left ciphers to be decoded and out of the four he sent, only one was definitely solved. The killer operated in California in the late <u>1960s and early 1970s</u>. His last letter said: Me- 37 and SFPD (San Francisco Police Dept.)- 0. He claimed to have killed <u>37 victims</u> but the newspapers confirmed only 7. The case file is still open.</dd><br>

                <dd>Gaskins has claimed to have killed between <u>80 to 90</u> people by torturing and mutilating them. He started killing in <u>1969</u>, picking up hitchhikers on the coastal highways of the American South. A criminal associate witnessed him killing two young men and confessed to the police. He was <u>sentenced to death</u> which was later turned to <u>life imprisonment without any parole</u>. Gaskins added another murder to his name and became the <u>only man to have ever killed an inmate on death row</u>.</dd><br>

                    <dd>He is also one of the most famous serial killers. He got more names due to his hideous acts. Some of them were <u>The Otaku Murderer, The Little Girl Murderer or Dracula Miyazaki</u>. The reason for this being that he abducted little girls, killed them and <u>indulged in sexual activities with their corpses</u>. On one occasion, he not only drank the victim’s blood but ate her hand as well. He also <u>preserved body parts as trophies</u> and sent postcards to the families describing the murder. His father committed suicide and <u>Miyazaki was hanged in 2008</u>, aged 45.</dd><br>

                    <dd><u>Unidentified</u> serial killer active in the impoverished districts in and around Whitechapel in the <u> End of London in 1888</u>. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved <u>female prost***tes</u> who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London.
                        The name "Jack the Ripper" originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The <u>"From Hell" letter</u> received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee came with <u>half of a preserved human kidney</u>, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, mainly because of both the extraordinarily <u>brutal nature of the murders and media coverage of the crimes</u>.</dd><br>

Many used arsenic as their deadly weapon, and some killed over 100 people. Here’s a list of the 10 most famous female serial killers:</p>
